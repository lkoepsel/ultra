# ultra: ultrasonic speaker
## Description
Uses an Arduino Uno, electronic components and a finite state machine (*FSM*) to create a multimodal ultrasonic speaker.

### Microcontroller
Currently uses an Arduino Uno powered by a 1000mAH battery, USB switch and USB cable.

### Electronic parts
* (2) push buttons
* (3) LEDs with current limiting resistors
* (1) low power audio speaker
* tbd audio amplifier circuit

### Software
Uses a 8-state FSM to determine which routine to run. The two buttons cycle through the FSM (up or down) and each state drives a particular routine:

* State 0:
* State 1:
* State 2:
* State 3:
* State 4:
* State 5:
* State 6:
* State 7:
